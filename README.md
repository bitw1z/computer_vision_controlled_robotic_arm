# computer_vision_controlled_robotic_arm
# Introduction
The robotic arm is equipped with an ESP32 camera to perform real-time object detection and utilizes inverse kinematics to calculate joint angles for precise positioning. This project integrates serial communication between Python and Arduino to control the servo motors. 

# Features
* Real-time Object Detection
