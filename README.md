# computer_vision_controlled_robotic_arm
## Introduction
This project enables a robotic arm to autonomously manipulate objects using ESP32 camera for real-time object detection and Arduino Uno for servo motor controls. 

## Features
- Real-time Object Detection: Utilizes an ESP32 camera for object detection and leverages pretrained YOLOv3 weights to identify objects in the video stream.
- Robotic Arm Control: The arm is controlled using inverse kinematics to calculate joint angles required to move the arm to a desired position.
